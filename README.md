# CrewAI-Tools
```python
# Tools for CrewAI

# To make this tool available for agents to use within CrewAI, you would then assign this tool to an agent like so:

# python

from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool

# Create the autogen_skill_tool as a Tool object
autogen_skill = Tool(
    name="AutogenSkillTool",
    func=autogen_skill_tool,
    description="Generates Python code for a tool based on a skill description."
)

# Define an agent and assign the autogen_skill_tool
developer_agent = Agent(
    role='Developer',
    goal='Generate Python tools based on skill descriptions',
    backstory='An AI developer capable of translating skill descriptions into executable Python tools.',
    tools=[autogen_skill],
    verbose=True
)

# In this setup, developer_agent is an agent that has been equipped with the autogen_skill_tool. This agent can now use this tool to generate Python functions based on skill descriptions autonomously as part of its tasks within a CrewAI setup.
