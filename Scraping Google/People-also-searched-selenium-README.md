<h2>People Also Ask Selenium</h2>

<p>To utilize Selenium scraping tool with proxy support in a CrewAI environment, you'll need to follow these steps to create and integrate an agent that uses this tool.</p> 
<br>
<h2><strong>Step 1: Define the Tool</strong></h2>
<p>First, ensure your tool is correctly defined using the @tool decorator with proxy support as discussed. This tool should be capable of scraping data using Selenium and undetected ChromeDriver, with the ability to randomly select a proxy from a list specified in an .env file.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Set Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>Ensure your <strong>.env</strong> file contains the <strong>proxy_list</strong> variable with your proxies listed and separated by commas. Also, ensure all required packages, including <strong>crewai, undetected-chromedriver, and python-dotenv</strong>, are installed in your environment.</p>

<br><h2>Step 3: Create an Agent</h2>
<p>Define an agent that will use the scraping tool. Here's an example of how you might define such an agent:</p>

```python

from crewai import Agent

# Assuming 'scrape_paa_with_proxy' is your tool function
from your_tool_module import scrape_paa_with_proxy

# Define your agent
scraper_agent = Agent(
    role='Web Scraper',
    goal='Scrape web data using proxies',
    backstory='A sophisticated web scraping agent designed to gather information stealthily.',
    tools=[scrape_paa_with_proxy]
)

```
<p>To utilize the previously discussed Selenium scraping tool with proxy support in a CrewAI environment, you'll need to follow these steps to create and integrate an agent that uses this tool. <strong>Here's a simplified guide to help you get started:</strong></p>
<h2>Step 1: Define the Tool</h2>
<br>
<p>First, ensure your tool is correctly defined using the @tool decorator with proxy support as discussed. This tool should be capable of scraping data using Selenium and undetected ChromeDriver, with the ability to randomly select a proxy from a list specified in an .env file.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 2: Set Up Your Environment</h2>
<br>
<p>Ensure your .env file contains the proxy_list variable with your proxies listed and separated by commas. Also, ensure all required packages, including <strong>crewai, undetected-chromedriver, and python-dotenv,</strong> are installed in your environment.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 3: Create an Agent</h2>
<br>
    
<p>Define an agent that will use the scraping tool. Here's an example of how you might define such an agent:</p>
<br>

```python

from crewai import Agent

# Assuming 'scrape_paa_with_proxy' is your tool function
from your_tool_module import scrape_paa_with_proxy

# Define your agent
scraper_agent = Agent(
    role='Web Scraper',
    goal='Scrape web data using proxies',
    backstory='A sophisticated web scraping agent designed to gather information stealthily.',
    tools=[scrape_paa_with_proxy]
)
<br>
Step 4: Define a Task</h2>
<p>Create a task that specifies what the agent needs to do. For instance, the task might be to scrape a specific page or data point:</p>

```

```python

from crewai import Task

# Define the task for scraping
scraping_task = Task(
    description='Scrape the People Also Ask section from a specified web page',
    agent=scraper_agent,  # Assign the task to your scraper agent
    tools=[scrape_paa_with_proxy],  # Specify the tool the agent will use
    # Add other task parameters as needed
)

```

<h2>Step 5: Assemble the Crew</h2>
<p>Combine your agents into a crew and set the workflow process they'll follow to accomplish the tasks:</p>

<br>

```python

from crewai import Crew, Process

# Assemble your crew
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[scraper_agent],  # List all agents part of the crew
    tasks=[scraping_task],  # List all tasks
    process=Process.sequential  # Define the process flow (sequential, hierarchical, etc.)
)

```
<h2>Step 6: Initiate the Crew</h2>

```python

# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

```

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your agent's tool is appropriately configured to handle the task requirements.</li>
<li>Adjust the .env file, task definitions, and crew configurations as needed for your specific use case.</li>
<li>Monitor the execution to ensure the proxy functionality is working as expected and to handle any potential issues with web scraping or proxy rotation</li>.</p>
