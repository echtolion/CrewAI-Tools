<h3>Tool Draft: Keyword Analysis Tool</h3>
<p><strong>Tool Name:</strong> Keyword Analysis Tool</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>This tool is designed to automate the process of keyword research by reading data from Excel files located in a specific directory. It identifies high-volume, low-competition keywords and saves the analysis in JSON format. Each file's findings are stored in a new directory, named after the original Excel file, ensuring organized storage and easy access to keyword research results.</p>
<p><strong>Inputs Schema:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><em>source_directory:</em> The directory containing the Excel files with keyword data (e.g., "Google_Keyword_Tool_Data").</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Read Excel Files:</strong> Access the source_directory and iteratively read each Excel file containing keyword data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> For each file, process the data to identify keywords that meet the criteria of high-volume (based on search volume) and low-competition (based on competition index).</li>
    <li><strong>Save Findings:</strong> For each processed Excel file, create a new directory under output_base_directory, named after the original file. Inside this directory, save the findings in a JSON file named after the original Excel file.</li>
    <li><strong>Output Structure:</strong> The JSON file will contain an array of objects, each representing a keyword and its relevant metrics (search volume, competition index).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Directories and JSON files within output_base_directory, each corresponding to an Excel file processed. The JSON files will contain the high-volume, low-competition keyword analysis results.</li>
