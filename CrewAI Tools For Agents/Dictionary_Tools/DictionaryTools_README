# Utilizing DictionaryTools in a CrewAI Agent

## Step 1: Initialization of Dictionary Tools

Ensure the DictionaryTools class is correctly defined, equipped with the method to fetch word definitions from the dictionary API. After ensuring this setup, proceed with initializing the dictionary tools:

```markdown
# Assuming the DictionaryTools class has been defined as described

# Initialize the Dictionary tools
dictionary_tools = DictionaryTools()
```

## Step 2: Creating a Lexicographer Agent

Construct an agent with the specific task of fetching definitions for given words. Assign the fetch_word_definition tool from the DictionaryTools to this agent:

```markdown
# Create an agent and assign the fetch_word_definition tool
lexicographer_agent = Agent(
    role='Lexicographer',
    goal='Fetch definitions for given words',
    tools=[dictionary_tools.fetch_word_definition]
)
```

## Step 3: Example Usage of Tool

Demonstrate the agent's capability to fetch word definitions by utilizing the assigned tool. Here's how to invoke the tool and display a word's definition:

### Fetching Word Definition:

```markdown
# Example usage: Fetching the definition of a word
word = "hello"
definition = lexicographer_agent.tools[0](word)  # Invokes the fetch_word_definition tool
print(f"Definition of {word}: {definition}")
```

## Conclusion

Integrating DictionaryTools into a CrewAI agent allows for dynamic and specific interaction with external data sources, such as a dictionary API. This example underscores the power of CrewAI agents to conduct specialized tasks—here, lexicographical research—by leveraging custom tools tailored to precise needs.
