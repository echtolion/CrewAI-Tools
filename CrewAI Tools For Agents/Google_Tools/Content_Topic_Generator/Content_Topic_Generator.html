        <li>Read Excel Files: The tool reads each Excel file in the specified source directory, extracting keyword data.</li>
        <li>Analyze Keyword Data: It analyzes keyword popularity, search intent, and user focus from the data.</li>
        <li>Generate Content Ideas: Based on the analysis, the tool generates content ideas that are likely to perform well in search engines.</li>
        <li>Save Content Ideas: The generated ideas are saved as JSON files in the specified output directory.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>Access to the CrewAI framework and basic understanding of its functionality.</li>
        <li>Pandas library installed for data manipulation. Install via pip: <code>pip install pandas</code></li>

        <li><strong>Configure Directories:</strong> Set the source directory containing your Excel files and the output directory where the JSON files will be saved.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> Execute the tool using Python. It will process each Excel file to generate content ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Generated Ideas:</strong> Check the output directory for JSON files named after the original Excel files. Each file contains an array of generated content ideas.</li>
    </ol>
